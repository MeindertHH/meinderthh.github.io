# Meindert's personal notebook

On this page I will post some random thoughts, curated links, quotes, and notes. These are unthemed curiosities on math, investing, tech, gadgets, programming, home improvement, politics, cultural explorations, food, paragliding, and basically whatever.

Just some things that I find interesting, and that may be of help to you.
